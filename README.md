# HighlightAtMouseHoverSample-ForWpf

### Description

In this WPF project, we show you how to highlight a feature when the user hovers the mouse pointer over it. This effect can be realized in Map Suite by using a timer and doing some spatial querying based on the location of the mouse pointer. This sample works with area-based features but the same could be accomplished with point- or line-based features simply by using different spatial queries.
